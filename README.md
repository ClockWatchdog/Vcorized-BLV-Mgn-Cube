The aim is to use as much of the hardware as possible that come with the BLV kits (see fysetc), with the obvious exception of the part involving the kinematics, such as bearings, M5 bolts and nuts and ofc 9mm Belts. I will add some specs during time. At the moment you will find the right part of the kinematics containing all the necessary hardware (the left part uses the same things). I Suggest to print the part in something like PA-CF or PC (like PCblend from Prusa), even the PETG CF can work fine with a nice rigidity and resistance. Care to PA (not CF), in some brand i noticed a good amount of deformation during time. The printability of the Y parts is improved compared to the Vcore parts. I splitted the part in 2 pieces to have a better tolerance in the spot that will host bearings and washers. The step file will receive upgrades and changes during time.
This kit regards only the kinematics, for the other parts, like Z axis, bed, LCD etc, you have to use the original files for BLV Mgn Cube. I added some rework for the bed and Z axis, you can find them here on Printables https://www.printables.com/model/349873-blv-printable-parts-rework-for-better-pintability-/files

PS I will add the compatibility with 1515 extrusion and MGN7 for the gantry, due to the fact that some tests gave very good results with this combination, and it would be nice to have some other feedback for this one.
